# bookmarklet, for "open this on my home instance"

## why
If you're browsing posts on their home server, and you want to reply, or follow a user, or boost it, there are obstacles.
This bookmarklet makes it easy.


## how
I used ["Instance changer", from Iain Murray](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/code/mastodon.html).
Dragging the bookmarklet it generated to my browser Favorites, or Bookmarks Toolbar, saved it as "mstdnüîÅ".
When I click it, it loads the remote post or account on mefi.social.

I've had to re-run this after instance updates, like when we went from Hometown and Mastodon v3 to v4.

If you want to read the generated bookmarklet for the above, [I saved it in an issue](https://github.com/pronoiac/mefi.social/issues/18).
It's both easy to skim if you know Javascript, and long and cryptic enough to be intimidated if you don't know Javascript, so I skipped it here.


## some wordplay for this, alternate titles
* "we have that post at home"
* "take me home"
