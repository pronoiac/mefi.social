# mefi.social, rules

## about
These rules appear on the [instance's About page](https://mefi.social/about).
They're set under Preferences / Administration / Server Rules.
While below, they're written in Markdown, in practice they're copypasta, one at a time, no html or markdown.
There's a 300-character limit for each rule.

## rules
* Sexually explicit or violent media must be marked as sensitive when posting.
* No harassment, dogpiling or doxxing of other users.
* Don't be a dick.
* No sexism, no fascism, no colonialism, no white supremacy, no religious extremism, no nationalism, no racism, no homophobia, no transphobia.
* No violence: It can be okay to talk in strongly critical terms about people's words but don't cross the line into any threats of violence or wishing violence on other people.
* No hacking: don't attack the system integrity, e.g. breaking into another user's account
* No impersonation or misrepresentation: pretending to be somebody else.
* Safe Space: LGTBQIA+
* Safe Space: neurodivergent (ADHD, Autism, etc.)

* [issue: code of conduct](https://github.com/pronoiac/mefi.social/issues/10)
* [local-only thread](https://mefi.social/@pronoiac/109982460760917172) discussing it
* if you want to discuss it with me, I'm [@pronoiac@mefi.social](https://mefi.social/@pronoiac).

## why is this here?
I'm including this copy in the repo because I wanted:
* an up-to-date copy, or at least one that could be updated in place
* a stable URL
* be able to show older versions
* context, like the rules from other instances I based this on
* links to the other discussions

A Mastodon thread and a Github issue weren't great for these.
