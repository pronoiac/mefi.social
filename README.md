## about mefi.social
[mefi.social](https://mefi.social/about/) is a Mastodon instance.

mefi.social is a Mastodon instance for [Metafilter](https://metafilter.com).
It's unofficial - it's not controlled or owned by Metafilter.
Everyone on here was verified as a Metafilter member.
It's currently open to Metafilter members by invite only; request an invite by [MeFi Mail to "mefi dot social"](https://www.metafilter.com/user/326460) or [Pronoiac](https://www.metafilter.com/user/50009)
Not a replacement for Metafilter or Metatalk.

## about this repo
Pronoiac started this to gather context, and track changes made to the instance.

[Issues](https://github.com/pronoiac/mefi.social/issues) are mostly notes to myself right now.
Reading Mastodon is _very_ ephemeral; it's hard to find something I _just_ read, and this is an attempt to organize that a bit.
